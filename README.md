# Handy Thoughts
## Dedicated to the Journal Lovers

[The Website](https://handythoughtsshop.herokuapp.com/)

## Introduction

For centuries, people have been writing diaries, notes, and making plans, which is a therapeutic potential of reflective writing. Even though so many other forms can help us track and remember our lives, such as taking pictures, videos, or voice recording, journaling is still one of the most important ways for individuals. We want to encourage people to use this method and find their minds and themselves in this traditional way. HandyThoughts is where paper lover can find their following favorite journals.

We offer our users many choices, from economical prices to money-worth high-quality journals.

## Marketing

#### Facebook Page

For marketing purposes, creating a Facebook Page is very important for business owners nowadays. To expose our product and future campaigns on FB is the best place. With such a significant volume of a user, starting a very niche page and attracting journal lovers could be easier than any other platform. 
Here below are the screen captures of the FB page.

![image](documentations/pics/fb/fb-page.png)
- The fb page is not yet published according to the instruction from the Web Marketing course
![image](documentations/pics/fb/fb-page-not-published.png)

#### Instagram
Another great platform is Instagram. Facebook is for the first generation of internet users, and Instagram targets younger generations. So far, there is an Instagram icon on the page's footer, but not linking to anything. In the future, hopefully, we will create an account and showcase our products to millions of potential customers out there.

#### Linked-In
There is a link to my linked-in account URL for business growth potential. For people interested in this business, or potential suppliers, it is an authentic platform to build up open and honest business possibilities. 

#### Newsletter
On the footer, there is a sign-up form embedded from Mailchimp. It is an excellent tool for the site owner to create a campaign by sending news to the customer's email address collected from this form.

## Bugs
- Wishlist Error: My biggest issue was when I tried to create a wishlist app. I had a blurry idea thinking it was more like a "shopping cart" function, but somehow, I wasn't clear about whether the user has an OneToOne relationship. I added an AUTH.USER.Model, which I set in the Products model. That worked for that time, but when I tried to deploy the project on Heroku, it threw an error about it violating the M2M rules. 
- Solution: After talking to my mentor Harry Dhillon, he walked me through the idea of a wishlist and showed me the logic of it. In the end, I added a new app called "wishlist" and put the models in there, and it worked out fine.


- Wishlist Migration Error: The Wishlist app was added after the project got deployed on Heroku. After I added the model, I couldn't make migrations. Threw errors and complaints there was no secret key.
- Solution: Tutor Alan told me I didn't put the secret keys in the local environment, even though they are on Heroku. Therefore, I created an env.py in the directory and added all related keys. It worked out fine then. 

- The Mailchimp newsletter box is not responsive on mobile phones: After I put the newsletter in the footer area, I found that it doesn't become smaller on a mobile screen. 
- Solution: After many tries on different flex settings or adding a CSS file, the ultimate problem was it wasn't included in the media queries area.


- Some common mistakes here and there: I followed along with the boutique ado project to create my project. Therefore not so many bugs come up, only when I was making my models, those more often bug me. But the most common ones are always "forget to add {% endblock %} or typos. 
- Solutions: Through this journey, I am a changed student, from someone who always starts a tutor session and can't understand the error messages (even though I know every word in the sentence, but putting them together was devastating) to someone who can calmly be looking at the error message, either spot the problems myself or google it, eventually fix it. Or even I start a tutor session, I still know how to ask the question or look at the answers without feeling useless and feel dumb when the tutor asks me questions. I find it is always challenging through time, but this course has taught me a lot, and I stopped being paranoid about the errors. I have built up my confidence as a developer.

## Special Thanks
I cannot believe I am writing this because my project deployed successfully.

I have to thank my mentor, Ronan McClelland, especially! He encourages me and suggests helpful documents, samples, and books. The books he recommended brought me to another level of understanding of Django better. I felt like another person. I built up much confidence in programming since I am grateful for his help. Without his encouragement and patience, I don't know if I can pull this off.

I have to thank another mentor Harry Dhillon. While I couldn't book with Ronan because his schedule was full, Harry accepted my request and had a meeting with me. He helped me with the wishlist app I wanted to create in the process but had so many problems early on. I almost gave up on it until he showed me the logic and ideas. It turned out I didn't figure out the OneToOne field in my origin model, which caused lots of problems. And it set my project done after that meeting. Very very thankful for that!

And then I must thank all the tutors, Ger Tobin, Christine Kelley, and Kevin Loughrey. You guys rock! You guys have been a great support to help me spot the bugs, explain the reasons, and show me patience, never look down on me when I am clueless. 

And to my friend Karin Oldbring, my friend, helped me through lots of emotional rollercoasters during the journey. She also inspired me to want to be better! She is a genius and has excellent front-end taste. We click almost immediately, and I can't appreciate her friendship more.
