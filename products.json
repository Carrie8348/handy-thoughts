The Journal Shop is proud to have been the UK's very first stockist and distributor of the range across Europe, as early as 2005 when the brand was formerly known as 'Midori Traveler's Notebook'. We fell in love with the notebook not just because of its good looks and toned-down minimalism, but also for its fine quality which has always remained just so. \r\n\r\nThe Traveler's notebook is hand-made from a single piece of leather in the northern city of Chiang Mai, Thailand - you'll notice that the notebook, when opened flat, does not have seams or any stitching. This is part of its unique charm and means that your notebook will have all the natural look and feel of that particular hide. When you first unbox your Traveler's notebook, you'll notice a fine white powder that covers the entire piece of leather; this is the natural oil that seeps from the skin and takes on a powdery appearance. Don't wipe it off - instead, gently brush it or massage it back into the leather to enrich the hide and keep it soft and supple. Make sure to frequently condition the leather by using specially formulated oils or wax designed to keep the leather from cracking.\r\n\r\nIf you love the look of a unique piece that ages over time and acquires marks, dents, and scratches that tell a story of a well-loved and used notebook, then this is a journal you'll no doubt appreciate. If your look is more decorative, you can accentuate the cover with charms, different colored bands, and stickers all available within the Traveler's Company range.\r\n\r\nIs it refillable?\r\nYes, that's one of its best features. Once you've used the refills inside, simply remove your refill, and replace it with a new one. Your Traveler's Notebook can hold up to four refills together (you can certainly try and squeeze a few more in but it tends to look quite bulky with more than four) and what's really nice is that you can change up the refills to suit the way in which you like to use your journal - ruled, grid, kraft paper or perhaps water colour paper for a spot of art.\r\n\r\nGood to know\r\n\r\nContents: Notebook (leather cover), cotton dust cover, plain MD paper refill, spare band, and kraft package. \r\nCover H220 x W120 x D10mm\r\nRefill H210 x W110 x D4mm\r\nPlan refill included contains 64 pages saddle stitched MD paper\r\nThe spare band included is Orange\r\nHand-made in Thailand", "image_url": null, "image": "Midori_TRAVELERS_Notebook_Brown.jpeg"}}, {"model": "products.product", "pk": 34, "fields": {"category": 4, "sku": "mdr004", "name": "Midori Sticker 2380 Marché Stationery", "price": "4.95", "brand": "Midori", "description": "Cute stationery themed stickers for the stationery fan in your life (we're guessing this could be you).
